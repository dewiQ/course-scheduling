This application was created using the Eclipse IDE with Java as the programming language. Apart from that, this application uses a genetic algorithm. To open it, you can use an IDE that supports the Java programming language.
When running the program the output will take a little longer because the data being processed is not connected to a database library and the data is only written manually in the programming script. The problem was due to not being able to find a suitable database library for the Eclipse IDE.
